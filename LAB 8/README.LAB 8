Overview
In Lab 8, you will explore the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on both artificial and real datasets. You will generate a two-dimensional dataset to understand how SVMs classify data into separable categories, and then apply SVM techniques to classify handwritten digits from the ZIP code dataset.
Objectives
•	Understand the mechanics of SVMs through practical application.
•	Demonstrate SVM's capability on a synthetic dataset with clear class separation.
•	Apply SVM to a real-world problem involving image classification.
Tasks and Instructions
Problem 1: SVM on Artificial Data
•	Data Generation:
o	Create a 2D dataset X with two distinct clusters. You can use numpy.random.multivariate_normal with different means for each cluster and identity matrices for covariance.
o	Generate an associated label vector y with values +1 and -1 indicating the cluster membership of each data point.
•	Model Training:
o	Train an SVM classifier using sklearn.svm.SVC with a linear kernel on the dataset.
•	Visualization:
o	Plot the dataset and the decision boundary determined by the SVM. Highlight the support vectors and ensure the decision boundary maximizes the margin between the two clusters.
Problem 2: SVM on Handwritten Digits
•	Data Preparation:
o	Load the zip.train and zip.test datasets which contain grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their labels.
•	Model Training and Selection:
o	Train an SVM model on the training data. Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal value for the regularization parameter C.
•	Evaluation:
o	Assess the performance of the SVM model on the test set by calculating its accuracy.
Deliverables
•	A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook containing:
o	Code for all tasks including data generation, model training, and evaluation.
o	Plots showing the SVM decision boundaries for the artificial dataset and any relevant visualizations for the real dataset.
•	A report within the notebook that discusses:
o	The SVM configurations tested and the rationale behind chosen parameters.
o	Observations from the model performance on both the synthetic and real datasets.
o	Challenges encountered during the lab and how they were addressed.
